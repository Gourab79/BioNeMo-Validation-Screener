# BioNeMo-Validation-Screener
A Virtual Screening Studio that leverages AI to speed up early-stage drug discovery. The application combines molecular similarity search (RDKit) with high-fidelity AI molecular docking (NVIDIA DiffDock) to simulate how promising drug candidates fit into target proteins, dramatically speeding up the validation phase of the pharmaceutical pipeline.

1. 📂 Project Setup (Required Files)Create a single folder named AetherDock and ensure you have these files inside it:File NamePurposeSourceapp.pyPython Backend (Flask, RDKit, API Routing)Code from previous stepindex.htmlFrontend (UI, NGL Viewer, JavaScript logic)Code from previous stepfetch_drugs_pro.pyData acquisition scriptCode from previous stepdrugs.jsonThe molecular databaseGenerated by fetch_drugs_pro.pyrequirements.txtLists Python dependenciesCreate manually (see Step 2)2. 📋 Dependencies (requirements.txt)Create the requirements.txt file and paste the following dependencies. Your system needs these libraries to run the scientific and web components:PlaintextFlask

3. 🔑 Get Your NVIDIA API KeyThe application relies on NVIDIA NIMs (NVIDIA Inference Microservices) for the powerful DiffDock simulation. You need an API key to access this service.ComponentWhere to find itNVIDIA API KeyGo to the NVIDIA AI Developer Program website and sign up or log in. You can generate a free API key (often labeled "API Key" or "NVAPI Key") from your dashboard.Environment VariableYou will use this key to set the NVIDIA_API_KEY environment variable in your terminal.⚙️ Step-by-Step ExecutionStep A: Set Up the EnvironmentOpen Terminal/Command Prompt and navigate to your AetherDock folder.Install Libraries: Run the installation command:Bashpip install -r requirements.txt
Set API Key: Set your environment variable (replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with the actual key you obtained):Mac/Linux: export NVIDIA_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"Windows (PowerShell): $env:NVIDIA_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"Step B: Generate the DatabaseRun the Fetch Script: Execute the data acquisition script to populate your database:Bashpython fetch_drugs_pro.py
(This script fetches drug data from ChEMBL/Wikipedia and saves it as the required drugs.json file.)Step C: Launch the ApplicationStart the Backend: Launch the Flask server:Bashpython app.py
Open Frontend: Open your web browser and navigate to the local address provided by Flask (usually http://127.0.0.1:5000).Step D: Perform a Virtual Screen (Testing the Pipeline)Get a Target PDB: Follow the guide to download the PDB file for a protein like COX-2 (5KIR). Copy all the text from the downloaded file.Paste Protein: Paste the entire PDB file content into the Target Protein Structure box.Search: Ensure the Query Ligand box contains a valid SMILES (e.g., COC(=O)c1ccccc1O). Click RUN MOLECULAR SEARCH.Validate: Once the candidate list appears, click DOCK on a high-percentage candidate. The system will send the data to the NVIDIA NIM, and the 3D viewer will display the final docked pose.
