# BioNeMo-Validation-Screener
A Virtual Screening Studio that leverages AI to speed up early-stage drug discovery. The application combines molecular similarity search (RDKit) with high-fidelity AI molecular docking (NVIDIA DiffDock) to simulate how promising drug candidates fit into target proteins, dramatically speeding up the validation phase of the pharmaceutical pipeline.
